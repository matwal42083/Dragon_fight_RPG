## JavaScript *RPG* Game Example by freeCodeCamp 
An RPG game that I build along with freeCodeCamp, for a *JavaScript* Example. Learning to build JavaScript games is good JavaScript practice. One thing that I like about this program is when you click on the buttons, the text on the buttons changes when you click on them. Learning how to do this is very useful. For the fact that you can take the same concept and implement it to something else. For example, when you want buttons that change it's text when clicked on
